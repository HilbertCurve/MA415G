    <title>Permutations</title>
    
    <p>
        So far, we have focused our study on three types of combinatorial objects:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    binary strings
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    subsets of a finite set
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    integer compositions
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        These objects have naturally led us to identify and study integer sequences and triangles, such as powers of two, binomial coefficients, and Fibonacci numbers.
    </p>

    <remark>
        <p>
        One aspect of combinatorics and graph theory that makes it have a different feel than courses such as advanced calculus, modern algebra, topology, or geometry is that combinatorics and graph theory tend to initially feel "broad" instead of "deep".
        So, rather than picking one topic, such as binomial coefficients, and spending half of the course studying these, we will instead survey a broad range of combinatorial objects.
        Each family of combinatorial objects that we study will lead us to different integer sequences and triangles, and to different strategies for enumeration.
        While every subject in Mathematics eventually becomes both broad and deep, there are differences between subjects in how they are perceived by students upon a first encounter.

    <p>
        Our next object of study is permutations of a finite set.
        Permutations are important in mathematics, computer science, social sciences, and beyond.

<definition xml:id="def-permutation">
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <em>permutation</em> of a finite set <m>A</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to itself.
            The set of permutations of <m>[n]</m> is denoted by <m>\S_n</m> and is called the <em>symmetric group on <m>n</m> elements</em>.

        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>

<p>
    Since a permutation in <m>\S_n</m> is a bijection, it is a function from <m>[n]</m> to itself.
    There are multiple ways to represent a permutation.
    At first, we will use <em>one-line notation</em>.
    Given a permutation <m>\pi\in \S_n</m>, which is a bijection
    <me>
        \pi:[n]\to [n] \, ,
    </me>
    we define <m>\pi_i:=\pi(i)</m> and then the one-line notation for <m>\pi</m> is 
    <me>
        \pi = \pi_1\pi_2\pi_3\cdots \pi_n \, .
    </me>
</p>

<example>
    <p>
    Suppose <m>\pi\in\S_5</m> is defined by 
    <me>
        \pi(1)=3, \, \pi(2)=5, \, \pi(3)=2, \, \pi(4)=1 \, ,\pi(5)=4 \, .
    </me>
    Then the one-line notation for <m>\pi</m> is 
    <me>
        \pi=35214 \, .
    </me>
    We would write <m>\pi_3=2</m> for this permutation.
    </p>
</example>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Write down all of the elements of  <m>\S_n</m> for <m>n=1,2,3,4</m>.
        How do you know that you did not miss any?
    </p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
    <p>
        What strategy/strategies did you develop to systematically list the elements of the symmetric group?
    </p>
</exercise>

<p>
    Recall that <m>n!:=n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1</m> is the <em>factorial</em> of <m>n</m>.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-symmetricgroupcardinality">
    <statement>
        <p>
            <m>|\S_n|=n!</m>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<p>
    We will give two proofs, one using combinatorial reasoning, and one using recursion.
</p>

<proof>
    <title>Combinatorial Reasoning Proof of <xref ref="thm-symmetricgroupcardinality"/></title>
    <p>
       For any permutation <m>\pi\in\S_n</m>, <m>\pi_1</m> can be any of <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}</m>.
       Thus, there are <m>n</m> choices for <m>\pi_1</m>.
       Once <m>\pi_1</m> is known, then <m>\pi_2</m> can be any of the remaining values, and there are <m>n-1</m> possible values remaining.
       Thus, there are <m>n\cdot (n-1)</m> possibilities for <m>\pi_1\pi_2</m>.
       Continuing in this way, we have <m>n-3</m> possibilities for <m>\pi_3</m>, then <m>n-4</m> possibilities for <m>\pi_4</m>, etc., and so on until there is only one possible value for <m>\pi_n</m>.
       Thus, there are <m>n!</m> permutations in <m>\S_n</m>.
    </p>

        Discuss this proof.
        Does it make sense? Why or why not?

        Do you like this proof? Why or why not?

<proof>
    <title>Recursive Proof of <xref ref="thm-symmetricgroupcardinality"/></title>
    <p>
        First, we can check that this is true for small values of <m>n</m>.
        So, we will use a strategy we have used before: use that this is true for <m>\S_1</m> to deduce that it is true for <m>\S_2</m>, then use that it is true for <m>\S_2</m> to deduce that it is true for <m>\S_3</m>, and so on.
        In this way, we will show it is true for every <m>n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each <m>\pi\in \S_n</m>, the value <m>n</m> is at some position in <m>\pi</m>.
        Let <m>X_i</m> be the set of permutations in <m>\pi\in \S_n</m> with <m>\pi_i=n</m>, which we can also write as:
        <me>
            X_i:=\{\pi\in \S_n:\pi_i=n\}
        </me>
        Since <m>n</m> is in only one position in each permutation, we have that
        <me>
            \S_n = X_1\uplus X_2\uplus \cdots \uplus X_n \, .
        </me>
        Therefore, 
        <me>
            |\S_n|=|X_1| + |X_2| + \cdots + |X_n| \, .
        </me>
        For any <m>i</m>, removing <m>n</m> from each permutation in <m>X_i</m> results in a copy of <m>\S_{n-1}</m>.
        Thus, <m>X_i</m> is obtained by taking <m>\S_{n-1}</m> and inserting an <m>n</m> in the <m>i</m>-th position of each permutation.
        Thus, <m>|X_i|=(n-1)!</m> for every <m>i</m>, and hence
        <me>
             |\S_n|= n\cdot (n-1)! = n! \, .
        </me>
    </p>
