    <title>Proofs</title>
    <p>
    The idea of <i>mathematical proof</i> is generally misunderstood by students.
    This is partially because it is not well-understood even by professional mathematicians.
    The key issue is that different people have different answers to the following three questions:
        <ol> 
        <li>What is Mathematics? </li>
        <li>What is the purpose of Mathematics? </li>
        <li>What are the criteria for Mathematics to be good or bad?</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    <exercise>
    <p>
        How would you answer the second question?
