      <title>Eight Foundational Questions</title>
      <p> We will be studying combinatorics and graph theory. 
      We will be addressing the following eight foundational questions of combinatorics and graph theory:
      <ol>
        <li>Enumeration: How many ____ are there?</li>
        <li>Classification: Which objects have ____ property?</li>
        <li>Expectation: How likely is ____?</li>
        <li>Optimization: What is the best ____?</li>
        <li>Ethics: What are the ethical implications that arise when applying ____ to the physical, biological, health, or social sciences?</li>
        <li>Sampling and Construction: How do I generate examples of ____?</li>
        <li>Existence: Does ____ exist?</li>
        <li>Estimation: Approximately how many ____ are there?</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      Rules for small group discussions:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First, begin the discussion by going around your group and having each person give a 10-second answer to the question.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Second, go around the group again and give a 10-second follow-up answer. This allows everyone to have a chance to offer their thoughts before the general discussion begins.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Third, have a general discussion.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
