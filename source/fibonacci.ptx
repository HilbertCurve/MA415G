    <title>Fibonacci Numbers</title>
    <p>
        Fibonacci numbers are a classic topic in combinatorics.
        They count many different objects, and their history is discussed at length on <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence"> their wikipedia page </url>.

                Let <m>F_0:=1</m> and let <m>F_1:=1</m>.
                Define the sequence <m>F_0,F_1,F_2,\ldots</m> using these initial conditions and the recurrence
                <me>
                    F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \, .
                </me>          
                This sequence is called the <em>Fibonacci sequence</em> and the numbers in the sequence are called the <em>Fibonacci numbers</em>.

            With your group, calculate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

<p>
    The Fibonacci numbers arise throughout mathematics.
    One of the basic problems they solve is counting integer compositions.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-composition">
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <em>composition</em> of a positive integer <m>n</m> is an ordered sum
            <me>
                x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_k = n
            </me>
            where each <m>x_i</m> is a positive integer. 
            We call each <m>x_i</m> a <em>part</em> of the composition.           
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>
    Each of <m>1+3+5+2+1+1+2</m> and <m>10+5</m> and <m>5+10</m>  are compositions of <m>15</m>.
    </p>
</example>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Systematically list all the compositions of <m>n</m> for <m>n=1,2,3,4</m>.
    </p>
</exercise>

<p>
    Let <m>\comp(n,A)</m> denote the set of compositions of <m>n</m> using parts from the set <m>A</m>.
    So, for example, the set of all compositions of <m>n</m> is <m>\comp(n,\Z)</m>.
</p>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Systematically list all the compositions in <m>\comp(n,\{1,2\})</m> for <m>n=1,2,3,4,5</m>.
    </p>
</exercise>

<theorem xml:id="thm-fibonaccicompositions">
    <statement>
        <p>For all positive integers <m>n</m>, we have
            <me>|\comp(n,\{1,2\})|=F_n \, .</me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
    <p>
        We use the technique of writing the set <m>\comp(n,\{1,2\})</m> as a disjoint union.
        Observe that <m>\comp(n,\{1,2\})</m> is equal to
        <me> \left\{ a+1:a\in\comp(n-1,\{1,2\}) \right\} \uplus \left\{ 2+a:a \in \comp(n-2,\{1,2\}) \right\} </me>
      and therefore
      <me>
        |\comp(n,\{1,2\})|=|\comp(n-1,\{1,2\})|+|\comp(n-2,\{1,2\})| \, .
      </me>
      Since <m>|\comp(1,\{1,2\})|=1</m> and <m>|\comp(2,\{1,2\})|=2</m>, the number of compositions using parts from <m>\{1,2\}</m> has the same initial conditions as the Fibonacci numbers starting at <m>F_1</m> and satisfies the same recurrence.
      Thus, our proof is complete.   
    </p>
</proof>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Discuss the proof above with your group.
        Does the disjoint union make sense?
        Use the lists of compositions that you generated to check this for small values of <m>n</m>.
    </p>
</exercise>

<p>
    Our final topic for Fibonacci numbers is a connection with binomial coefficients.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-fibonacciasbinomials">
    <statement>
        <p>
            For each positive integer <m>n</m>, we have
            <me>F_n=|\comp(n,\{1,2\})|=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}\binom{n-k}{k}</me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Discuss with your group: how might you prove this? What strategy could you use? How could binomial coefficients be related to compositions using ones and twos?
    </p>
</exercise>

<proof>
    <p>
        The number of compositions of <m>n</m> using <m>k</m> copies of <m>2</m> is given by <m>\binom{n-k}{k}</m>.
        Since every element of <m>\comp(n,\{1,2\})</m> uses at most <m>\lfloor n/2 \rfloor</m> parts equal to <m>2</m>, the sum counts all the compositions.
    </p>
</proof>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Discuss this proof. 
        Does it make sense? Why or why not?
    </p>
</exercise>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Rewrite the proof above using the strategy to express the set <m>\comp(n,\{1,2\})</m> as a disjoint union of sets of compositions with a fixed number of <m>2</m>'s.
    </p>
</exercise>
