    <p>
        Fibonacci numbers are a classic topic in combinatorics.
        They count many different objects, and their history is discussed at length on <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence"> their wikipedia page </url>.

                Let <m>F_0:=1</m> and let <m>F_1:=1</m>.
                Define the sequence <m>F_0,F_1,F_2,\ldots</m> using these initial conditions and the recurrence
                <me>
                    F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \, .
                </me>          
                This sequence is called the <em>Fibonacci sequence</em> and the numbers in the sequence are called the <em>Fibonacci numbers</em>.
