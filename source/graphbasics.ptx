    <p>
        Many stuctures in the world involve pairwise connections.
        For example, in a group of people, we could connect each pair of people who are friends.
        In a city and road network, we can consider two cities connected if there is a road connecting them without any other cities on that road.
        In a computer network, two computers can be considered connected if they have a direct cable link between them, without any intermediary system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mathematical structure that captures the structure of pairwise connection is a <em>graph</em>, also called a <em>network</em>.

                A <em>graph</em> <m>G</m>, also called a <em>network</em>, consists of a finite set <m>V=V(G)</m> called the <em>vertices</em> or <em>nodes</em> of <m>G</m> and a collection <m>E=E(G)</m> of unordered pairs of elements of <m>V</m> called the <em>edges</em> or <em>arcs</em> of <m>G</m>.

            The <em>complete graph</em>, denoted <m>K_n</m>, is the graph with <m>V=[n]</m> and every possible edge.
            Thus, <m>K_n</m> has <m>n</m> vertices and <m>\binom{n}{2}</m> edges.

            <p>
                For a vertex <m>v\in V(G)</m>, we say the <em>degree</em> of <m>v</m> is the number of edges in <m>E(G)</m> that contain <m>v</m>.
                We denote the degree of a vertex by <m>\deg_G(v)</m>, where we will write <m>\deg(v)</m> if <m>G</m> is clear from context.

    The first key result regarding graphs is the following.
</p>
<theorem xml:id="thm-degreesumformula">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Given a graph <m>G=(V,E)</m>, we have
            <me>
                \sum_{v\in V}\deg(v)=2|E| \, .
            </me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>
<proof>
    <p>
        We count the number of pairs <m>(v,e)</m> where <m>v\in e\in E</m> in two ways. 
        This is a strategy called "double counting".
        First, for each edge, there are two pairs <m>(v,e)</m>, one for each endpoint <m>v</m> of the edge.
        Thus, the total number of pairs is <m>2|E|</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, for each vertex, there are <m>\deg(v)</m> pairs <m>(v,e)</m>, one for each edge <m>e</m> containing <m>v</m>.
        Thus, there are a total of <m>\sum_{v\in V}\deg(v)</m> such pairs.
        Since both of these expressions count the same set, they are equal.
    </p>
</proof>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Discuss this proof. Does it make sense? Does it make sense why we call this type of proof "double counting"?

    We can use the result above to prove a fundamental qualitative result about graphs: the handshake lemma.
</p>
<theorem xml:id="thm-handshake">
    <title>Handshake Lemma</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            In any finite graph, there are an even number of vertices of odd degree.
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
    <p>
        Since <m>\sum_{v\in V}\deg(v)=2|E|</m>, the sum of the degrees is an even number. 
        If there were an odd number of vertices of odd degree, the sum would be odd, which is impossible.
    </p>
</proof>
<p>
    The handshake lemma allows us to obtain statements such as the following.
</p>
<corollary xml:id="cor-odddegreegraphs">
    <statement>
        <p>
            If every vertex of a graph has odd degree, then the graph has an even number of vertices.
        </p>
    </statement>
</corollary>
<p>
    Note that the theorem and corollary above do not tell us anything about how many vertices there are, or how many odd degree vertices there are.
    So, this is not a theorem or corollary that we can use to count with.
    However, these results do tell us qualitative information about the relationship between the degrees of a graph, the total number of edges, and limitations on the number of vertices of odd degree.
