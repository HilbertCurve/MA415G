        The simplest connected graphs are the connected graphs that have no cycles.
        There are many different descriptions of such graphs, meaning that there are many ways to classify this family of graphs.

                A graph is <em>acyclic</em> if it has no cycles.
                A graph on <m>n</m> vertices that is connected and acyclic is called a <em>tree</em>.

            Determining whether or not a graph is a tree is not always easy. 
            For example, the following graph is given both visually and as a list of edges.
            Is the following graph a tree? 
            How might you verify that your answer is correct?
            Discuss with your group.

        The following theorem lists multiple alternative characterizations of (finite) trees.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-treeclassification">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>G</m> be a graph on <m>n</m> vertices.
                The following are equivalent.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>G</m> is a tree, i.e., <m>G</m> is connected and acyclic.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>G</m> is connected and has <m>n-1</m> edges.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>G</m> is acyclic and has <m>n-1</m> edges.
                        </p>

                </ol>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
        What this theorem says is that <m>G</m> is a tree if it has any two of the properties of being connected, acyclic, or having <m>n-1</m> edges when it has <m>n</m> vertices.
