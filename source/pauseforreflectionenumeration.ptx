        So far, we have focused our study on three types of combinatorial objects:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    binary strings
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    subsets of a finite set
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    integer compositions
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        These objects have naturally led us to identify and study integer sequences and triangles, such as powers of two, binomial coefficients, and Fibonacci numbers.

    <remark>
        <p>
        One aspect of combinatorics and graph theory that makes it have a different feel than courses such as advanced calculus, modern algebra, topology, or geometry is that combinatorics and graph theory tend to initially feel "broad" instead of "deep".
        So, rather than picking one topic, such as binomial coefficients, and spending half of the course studying these, we will instead survey a broad range of combinatorial objects.
        Each family of combinatorial objects that we study will lead us to different integer sequences and triangles, and to different strategies for enumeration.
        While every subject in Mathematics eventually becomes both broad and deep, there are differences between subjects in how they are perceived by students upon a first encounter.

        Let's reflect a bit on how what we have done fits into the philosophical and psychological frameworks for Mathematics due to MacLane and Tall.
    </p>

    <exercise>
        <p>
            Recall the Table from MacLane's book given in <xref ref="fig-maclane"/>.
            Which of the items in the table have we been engaged with, either consciously or subconsciously, so far?
        </p>
    </exercise>
    

    <exercise>
        <p>
            Recall the picture representing Tall's Three Worlds framework given in <xref ref="fig-tall"/>.
            Where in these three worlds of mathematics have we been situated so far with the math we have done?
