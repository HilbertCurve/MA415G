  <title>Introduction</title>

    <p> We will be studying combinatorics and graph theory. 
        We will be addressing the following eight foundational questions of combinatorics and graph theory:
        <ol>
          <li>Enumeration: How many ____ are there?</li>
          <li>Classification: Which objects have ____ property?</li>
          <li>Expectation: How likely is ____?</li>
          <li>Optimization: What is the best ____?</li>
          <li>Sampling and Construction: How do I generate examples of ____?</li>
          <li>Existence: Does ____ exist?</li>
          <li>Estimation: Approximately how many ____ are there?</li>
          <li>Ethics: What are the ethical implications that arise when applying ____ to the physical, biological, health, or social sciences?</li>
        </ol>
