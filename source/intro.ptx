        <title>Eight Foundational Questions</title>
        <p> We will be studying combinatorics and graph theory. 
        We will be addressing the following eight foundational questions of combinatorics and graph theory:
        <ol>
          <li>Enumeration: How many ____ are there?</li>
          <li>Classification: Which objects have ____ property?</li>
          <li>Expectation: How likely is ____?</li>
          <li>Optimization: What is the best ____?</li>
          <li>Sampling and Construction: How do I generate examples of ____?</li>
          <li>Existence: Does ____ exist?</li>
          <li>Estimation: Approximately how many ____ are there?</li>
          <li>Ethics: What are the ethical implications that arise when applying ____ to the physical, biological, health, or social sciences?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Rules for small group discussions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              First, begin the discussion by going around your group and having each person give a 10-second answer to the question.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Second, go around the group again and give a 10-second follow-up answer. This allows everyone to have a chance to offer their thoughts before the general discussion begins.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Third, have a general discussion.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

        <title>Proofs</title>
        <p>
        The idea of <i>mathematical proof</i> is generally misunderstood by students.
        This is partially because it is not well-understood even by professional mathematicians.
        The key issue is that different people have different answers to the following three questions:
          <ol> 
            <li>What is Mathematics? </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of Mathematics? </li>
            <li>What are the criteria for Mathematics to be good or bad?</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
<exercise>
  <p>
    How would you answer each of these three questions?
