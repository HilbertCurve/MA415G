        <title>P1</title>
        <p>
            Define an <em><m>m</m>-ary string</em> to be an ordered list of length <m>n</m> where each entry is an element of <m>[m]:=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}</m>.
            We denote by <m>[m]^n</m> the set of <m>m</m>-ary strings of length <m>n</m>.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Systematically list the elements of <m>[3]^3</m> and <em>explain using written sentences</em> what your system is for listing all of these elements.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Give a <em>recursive</em> proof, following the structure of the recursive proof of <xref ref="thm-binarystringenumeration"/>, that 
                        <me>
                            |[m]^n|=m^n \, .
                        </me>

    <problem>
        <title>P2</title>
        <p>
            How many binary strings of length <m>n</m> are there with exactly two ones and <m>(n-2)</m> zeros?
            Express your answer as either a function of <m>n</m> or as a recursive expression.
            Give an argument, i.e., a proof, explaining why your solution is correct.

        <title>Essay 1</title>
        <p> Write an essay in which you reflect on a meaningful mathematical experience from your past.
This might be a positive experience or it might be a negative experience, but it should be something that was influential in your mathematical life, and <em>you should explicitly discuss how mathematical ideas/concepts were involved in this experience</em>.
As a prompt for your writing, consider some of the following questions (you do not need to respond to all of these, rather use them to help you get your writing started).
<ul>
<li><p>Was this influential because of the mathematical content you learned, or because of a personal experience that took place in a mathematical context, or because it changed how you thought about yourself with regard to mathematics, or something else entirely?</p></li>
<li><p> Did this experience cause you to take on future challenges, or to avoid certain challenges?</p></li>
<li><p> What was different about this experience from other similar experiences that makes this one stand out in your memory?</p></li>
</ul>
This assignment should be 500 words, which is equivalent to two pages, 12 point Times New Roman, double spaced.
Your grade is based on completion only (in other words, if you complete the assignment and it meets the length requirement and responds appropriately to the prompt, then you get full credit).

    <problem>
        <title>P3</title>
        <p>
            In this problem, we explore another property of binomial coefficients.
            Equations such as this are known as <em>combinatorial identities</em>, because they are equalities of expressions involving combinatorial values.
            Using the technique of disjoint union decompositions, prove that for any <m>0\leq k \leq n</m>, we have
                <me>
                    \binom{k}{k}+\binom{k+1}{k}+\binom{k+2}{k}+\cdots +\binom{n-1}{k}+\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n+1}{k+1} \, .

    <problem>
        <title>P4</title>
        <p>
            Give a combinatorial proof showing that
            <me>
                \sum_{k=0}^nk\binom{n}{k}=n2^{n-1} \, .
            </me>

    <problem>
        <title>P5</title>
        <p>
            <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singmaster%27s_conjecture">Singmaster's conjecture</url> is an open problem in mathematics, meaning that it is a problem that has not been solved by anyone.
            Note that the number <m>1</m> appears infinitely many times in the triangle of binomial coefficients.
            The open problem is as follows: Is there a fixed integer <m>N</m> such that every positive integer other than <m>1</m> shows up at most <m>N</m> times in the triangle of binomial coefficients?
        </p>
        <p>
            Make as much progress as you can on this open problem; I don't expect you to find a solution, but you should spend 2-3 hours thinking about this!
            Your goal is to do something more than check examples; the examples should lead you to make some interesting observations about the problem, to understand it a bit better.
            Why do you think it might be true?  
            Why might it be false?
            Are there any properties of binomial coefficients that support your comments?
            Are there any positive integers for which this is obviously true?
            (Seriously, write down everything you're thinking and every idea you try, even if it doesn't go anywhere.)

            For each positive integer <m>n</m>, express in terms of Fibonacci numbers the number of sequences
