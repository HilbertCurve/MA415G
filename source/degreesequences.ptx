    <title>Degree Sequences</title>

    <p>
        We have seen that the degrees of the vertices play several key roles for graphs.
        This leads us to the following definition and theorem.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-degreesequence">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Given a finite graph <m>G</m>, the <em>degree sequence</em> of <m>G</m> is the sequence of vertex degrees of <m>G</m> written in non-increasing order.
                If a sequence <m>\mathbf{d}=(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)</m> with <m>d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n</m> is the degree sequence of a graph, then we say <m>\mathbf{d}</m> is a <em>graphic sequence</em>.
                Note that there might be more than one graph with the same graphic sequence.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
        <p>
            The degree sequence of the following graph is <m>(7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2)</m>.

        The main question we will ask about degree sequences is: which non-increasing lists of integers are graphic?

        We will start by investigating a special class of graphs called <em>threshold graphs</em>.

        We start with the following lemma.
        We write <m>N_G(v)</m> or <m>N(v)</m> to denote the set of vertices in <m>G</m> that are adjacent to <m>v</m>, i.e., connected to <m>v</m> by an edge.

                Relabel the vertex set of a threshold graph <m>G</m> as <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}</m> such that <m>d_i=\deg(v_i)</m>. 
                With this labeling, if <m>N(v_j)</m> contains <m>s</m> elements, then <m>N(v_j)</m> consists of the first <m>s</m> vertices from the list

    </lemma>

    <proof>
        <p>
            We prove this by induction on the number of vertices in <m>G</m>.
            If there are one or two vertices, then this is true since the sets under consideration are empty.
            Now, suppose that <m>G'</m> is a threshold graph on <m>n</m> vertices for which the lemma holds. 
            When we add a vertex to <m>G'</m>, resulting in a graph <m>G</m> with one more vertex, then this can either happen through an isolated vertex or suspension move.
            If an isolated vertex is added, then none of the neighborhoods of the vertices change, and the new vertex (having degree zero) is labeled as <m>v_{n+1}</m>, so the result holds since it already holds for <m>G'</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a suspension vertex is added, then the new vertex has degree <m>n</m> and is labeled <m>v_1</m>, while all other vertices have their degrees increased by one and their labels are each increased by one.
            As <m>v_1</m> is added to the neighborhood of every existing vertex, then since <m>N_{G'}(v_j)</m> consists of the first <m>s</m> vertices from the list for <m>G'</m>, and the new <m>v_1</m> is a neighbor in <m>G</m> of every vertex in <m>G'</m>, we have that the claim regarding the initial segment of vertices being neighbors also holds in <m>G</m>.

    <proof>
        <title>Proof of <xref ref="thm-thresholdcharacterization"/></title>
        <p>
            To prove that a threshold graph <m>G</m> on <m>n</m> vertices satisfies 
            <me>
                \sum_{i=1}^k d_i = k(k-1) + \sum_{j=k+1}^n \min(k,d_j)
            </me>
            for every <m>1\leq k\leq m(\mathbf{d})</m>, we will count the quantity <m>\sum_{i=1}^k d_i</m> in two ways.
        First, observe that <m>\sum_{i=1}^k d_i</m> counts the number of vertex-edge pairs <m>(v,e)</m> where <m>v\in \{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}</m> and <m>v</m> is incident to <m>e</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Second, since <m>k\leq m(\mathbf{d})</m>, we have that <m>d_i\geq i-1</m> for all <m>i\leq k</m>, and thus <m>v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}</m> are all neighbors of each such <m>v_i</m>.
            Thus, the first <m>k</m> vertices in <m>G</m> form a complete graph, which has <m>k(k-1)/2</m> edges, leading to <m>k(k-1)</m> vertex-edge pairs.
            Each vertex <m>v_j</m> for <m>j\geq k+1</m> is connected to the first <m>d_j</m> vertices in <m>G</m>.
            If <m>d_j\geq k</m>, then this corresponds to <m>k</m> vertex-edge adjacencies involving a vertex in <m>\{v_1,\ldots,v_k\}</m>.
            If <m>d_j\lt k</m>, then this corresponds to <m>d_j</m> such adjacencies.
            Thus, the left-hand and right-hand side of the equality both enumerate the same set, and thus are equal.

        What is remarkable about threshold graphs is that they are the most extreme you can get with regard to these numerical relationships for degree sequences.
        Specifically, the following theorem due to Erdős and Gallai (which we will state without proof) characterizes graphical degree sequences by relaxing the equalities that we have been investigating.
