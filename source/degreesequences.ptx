    <title>Degree Sequences</title>

    <p>
        We have seen that the degrees of the vertices play several key roles for graphs.
        This leads us to the following definition and theorem.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-degreesequence">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Given a finite graph <m>G</m>, the <em>degree sequence</em> of <m>G</m> is the sequence of vertex degrees of <m>G</m> written in non-increasing order.
                If a sequence <m>\mathbf{d}=(d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n)</m> is the degree sequence of a graph, then we say <m>\mathbf{d}</m> is a <em>graphic sequence</em>.
                Note that there might be more than one graph with the same graphic sequence.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
        <p>
            The degree sequence of the following graph is <m>(7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2)</m>.

    <exercise>
        <p>
            For each of the following degree sequences, create a graph having that degree sequence.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>(2,2,2,2,2)</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>(5,2,2,1,1,1,1,1)</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>(6,3,3,3,3,3,3)</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </exercise>

    <p>
        The two main questions we will ask about degree sequences are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Which non-increasing lists of integers are graphic?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Given a non-increasing list of integers, how can we test to see if it is graphic?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        <p>
            Let's return to this graph again with degree sequence
            <me>
                (7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2) \, .
            </me>
            What would be ideal would be if we removed the vertex of degree <m>7</m> and what was left was a graph with degree sequence
            <me>
                (5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2) \, .
            </me>
            Note that this is what would happen if the vertex of degree <m>7</m> was connected to the highest-degree other vertices.
        </p>
            <figure xml:id="fig-degree_sequence2">
    <caption>Example for graph degree sequence</caption>
    <image source="degreesequencegraph.png" width="75%"/>
</figure>
        <p>
            However, there is a problem: the vertex of degree <m>7</m>, which is labeled vertex 7, is connected to a vertex of degree two.
            So, for this particular graph, removing the vertex of highest degree does not cause the degree
