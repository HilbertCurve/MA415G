    <title>Permutations: Cycle Structure and Derangements</title>
    
    <p>
        When we write permutations in one-line notation, some feature of the permutation are brought to the surface.
        However, other features are obscured.
        Thus, it is useful to have multiple representations of a permutation.
        Our next representation is called <em>cycle notation</em>.
    </p>

<definition xml:id="def-cycle">
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <em>cycle</em> in a permutation <m>\pi\in \ss_n</m> is a sequence of elements <m>(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)</m> with each <m>x_i\in [n]</m> satisfying
            <me>
                \pi(x_i)=x_{i+1} 
            </me>
            for all <m>m</m> and <m>\pi(x_k)=x_1</m>.
            The <em>length</em> of the cycle is the number of elements in the cycle.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>

<example>
    <p>
    In the permutation <m>37416528</m>, we have the cycle <m>(1,3,4)</m> of length three and the cycle <m>(8)</m> of length 1.

        Find all the cycles contained in <m>\pi=375916824</m>.

    <definition xml:id="def-cyclenotation">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let <m>\pi\in\ss_n</m>.
                We construct the <em>standard cycle representation</em> of a permutation <m>\pi\in\ss_n</m> as follows.
                First, create the cycle <m>C_1</m> containing <m>n</m>, with <m>n</m> listed first in <m>C_1</m>.
                Second, create the cycle <m>C_2</m> containing the largest value not in <m>C_1</m>, where the largest value is listed first.
                Third, create the cycle <m>C_3</m> containing the largest value not in <m>C_1</m> or <m>C_2</m>, where the largest value is listed first. 
                Continue in this fashion until all of the elements of <m>[n]</m> are in a cycle, resulting in cycles <m>C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k</m>, and then write
                <me>
                    \pi=C_kC_{k-1}\cdots C_2C_1 \, .
                </me>
                This is the standard cycle representation.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Write <m>\pi=375916824</m> in standard cycle representation.
        Draw the diagrams for all the cycles in <m>\pi</m>.
    </p>

<p>
    There are some special permutations that we will need names for:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <em>identity permutation</em> is the permutation <m>1234\cdots n</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                An <m>n</m>-cycle is a permutation consisting of only one cycle of length <m>n</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A cycle of length one in a permutation corresponds to a <em>fixed point</em>, since the cycle <m>(i)</m> in <m>\pi</m> indicates that <m>\pi_i=i</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A permutation with a single cycle of length two, and all other cycles of length one, is called a <em>transposition</em> because it exchanges, i.e., transposes, two values in <m>[n]</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A permutation is a <em>derangement</em> if it has no fixed points, i.e., if it has no one-cycles.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Create two examples for each of the definitions above.
    </p>
</exercise>

<theorem xml:id="thm-cyclecount">
    <statement>
        <p>
            There are <m>(n-1)!</m> cycles of length <m>n</m> in <m>\ss_n</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
    <p>
        Suppose <m>\pi</m> is an <m>n</m>-cycle in standard cycle representation; thus, the cycle begins with <m>n</m>.
        The remaining <m>n-1</m> entries can be any permutation in <m>\ss_{n-1}</m>, and the result follows.
    </p>
</proof>

<p>
    We will finish our survey of cycle structure by answering two questions.
    The first question is: how many derangements are there in <m>\ss_n</m>?
    The second question is: how many permutations in <m>\ss_n</m> have exactly <m>k</m> cycles in their standard cycle representation?
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-derangementcount">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>D_n</m> denote the number of derangements in <m>\ss_n</m>.
            Then <m>D_1=0</m> and <m>D_2=1</m>, and the remaining values satisfy the recursion
            <me>
                D_n=(n-1)(D_{n-1}+D_{n-2}) \, .
            </me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>


<exercise>
    <p>
        Use the recursion above to compute the first ten derangement numbers <m>D_n</m>.
    </p>
</exercise>

<proof>
    <p>
        It is straightforward to check that <m>D_1=0</m> and <m>D_2=1</m>.
        Let <m>\pi</m> be a derangement in <m>\ss_n</m> and consider the value of <m>\pi_1</m>.
        We know that <m>\pi_1=i\neq 1</m>. 
        There are now two possible cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the first case, <m>\pi_i=1</m>.
        Thus, the permutation <m>\pi</m> has a two-cycle of the form <m>(1,i)</m>.
        There rest of the permutation is a derangement on <m>[n]\setminus \{1,i\}</m>, and thus there are <m>(n-1)D_{n-2}</m> possible derangements <m>\pi</m> with this structure, since there are <m>n-1</m> possible values of <m>\pi_1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second case, <m>\pi_i\neq 1</m>.
        Counting derangements satisfying <m>\pi_1=i\neq 1</m> and <m>\pi_i\neq 1</m> is equivalent to counting derangements in <m>\ss_{n-1}</m>, since this is the same as counting permutations satisfying <m>\pi_1=1</m> and <m>\pi_j\neq j</m> for all <m>j>1</m> (just switch the roles of <m>1</m> and <m>i</m>).
        Since there are <m>n-1</m> possible values of <m>i</m>, this gives <m>(n-1)D_{n-1}</m> possible derangements <m>\pi</m> in this case.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding the number of possible derangements from the two cases gives the recursive formula in the theorem.
    </p>
</proof>


<exercise>
    <p>
        Discuss the above proof. Does it make sense? Why or why not?

</exercise>

<definition xml:id="def-stirlingfirstkind">
    <statement>
        <p>
            For integers <m>n,k\geq 0</m>, we denote by <m>c(n,k)</m> the number of permutations in <m>\ss_n</m> with exactly <m>k</m> cycles.
            The numbers <m>c(n,k)</m> are called <em>(signless) Stirling numbers of the first kind</em>.
            We define <m>c(0,0)=1</m> and <m>c(0,k)=0</m> for all <m>k\gt 0</m> and note that <m>c(n,0)=0</m> for all <m>n\gt 0</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>

<exercise>
    <p>
        Explain why <m>c(n,n-1)=\binom{n}{2}</m>.
    </p>
</exercise>

<theorem xml:id="thm-stirlingfirstkindrecurrence">
    <statement>
        <p>
            For <m>k\gt 0</m>, the Stirling numbers of the first kind satisfy the recursion
            <me>
                c(n,k)=(n-1)c(n-1,k)+c(n-1,k-1) \, .
            </me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
    <p>
        We express the permutations in <m>\ss_{n}</m> with exactly <m>k</m> cycles as <m>A_n\uplus B_n</m>, a disjoint union where <m>B_n</m> are the permutations with <m>n</m> contained in a cycle of length one, while <m>A_n</m> are those permutations where <m>n</m> is contained in a cycle of length at least two.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each permutation in <m>B_n</m>, if we remove the one-cycle containing <m>n</m>, then what remains is a permutation in <m>\ss_{n-1}</m> with <m>k-1</m> cycles.
        This accounts for <m>c(n-1,k-1)</m> permutations, which is the second summand in our recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each permutation in <m>A_n</m>, if we remove <m>n</m> from the cycle containing it, we obtain a permutation <m>\sigma\in\ss_{n-1}</m> with <m>k</m> cycles.
        Each such <m>\sigma</m> can be obtained from <m>(n-1)</m> different permutations in <m>A_n</m>, since there are <m>(n-1)</m> positions in <m>\sigma</m> where <m>n</m> could be inserted to obtain an element of <m>A_n</m>.
        Thus, there are <m>(n-1)c(n,k-1)</m> permutations in <m>A_n</m>, which is the first summand in our recursion.

        Use the recurrence for Stirling numbers of the first kind to create the first seven rows of a triangle, similar to the arithmetical triangle for binomial coefficients.
    Compare your triangle with the one given on the <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_first_kind#Table_of_values"> wikipedia page for Stirling numbers of the first kind.</url>.
